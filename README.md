Small minimal example for the usage of the
[Eventsource](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/EventSource)-API.

The server-side code is written in [golang](https://golang.org), but it is in no
way depending on this language. Any other should work just as well :)

This code was used in the chaotic quarter at [Noname e.V.](https:/noname-ev.de)
in Heidelberg, the recordings of which can be found [here](XXX).
